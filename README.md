# EDM-x-corr
Source code for linear regression analysis of Hg electric dipole moment experiment data This program calculates correlations between any pair of EDM experimental parameters (listed in paramlist_Tdiff.txt) from a specified list of EDM data runs (listed in series_res_all.txt). The correlations can be computed for raw data (retrieved from .ave files) or HV-correlated points (retrieved from .sum files). EDMx-corrPerpfit.c is the primary file, linfit-mod.c implements a linear regresssion algorithm from Numerical Recipes in C (ch. 15, section 3). Data points can also be scaled by HV magnitude and sign-flipped according to the direction of B_0, where both parameters are recorded in series_res_all.txt
